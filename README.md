# Web Development Project 3 - *Learning Animals in Spanish Part 2*

Submitted by: **Sebastian Stec**

This web app: **Allows the user to study their animals in Spanish using Flashcards. These flashcards can be shuffled through using the "Next" and "Previous" buttons, and their color changes depending on the difficulty (Green for easy, Yellow for medium, Red for hard). The user can enter their guess into a text box, and when they click the "Submit" button, the website will tell the user if their input was correct or incorrect, then flip the card to display the correct answer. The user can click on the card at any time to see the correct answer, but they will be unable to input their guess once this is done.**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total
